[alm](http://alm.tools/) is a available as an npm package `npm install alm -g` 🌹
It is essentailly a web server that you can use anywhere you can use `nodejs`.

However people have shown a lot of interest in a standalone version that you can run as a desktop application. This project just bundles `alm` with `electron`.

# Usage

```
npm install almo -g
```

Now just run `almo` like you would run alm :) but without the need for a `-o` argument ;).
